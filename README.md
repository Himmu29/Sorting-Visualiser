I created a sorting visualizer tool that enables users to visually observe the process of sorting algorithms, specifically bubble sort and selection sort. This visualizer provides an interactive and intuitive way to understand how these sorting algorithms work by displaying each step of the sorting process in real-time. It's an educational tool designed to help students, developers, and anyone interested in sorting algorithms to gain a deeper understanding of how elements are compared, swapped, and ultimately sorted in an array. The visualizer is easy to use and can serve as a valuable resource for learning and teaching sorting algorithms.
